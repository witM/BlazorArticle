# BlazorArticle

The **BlazorArticle** package is experimental package for .net for supporting rendering parsed article from database (html article currently). Within an article you can render interactive blazor components. This is all SEO friendly by rendering article with components on server side. The articles may have different styles also rendered from database.

The library will be good for bloggers and other educational content.

## Installation and documentation

The first version of library is under development...when it will be ready it will be published just as the "BlazorArticle" package.

The documentation will be build at GitHub repository when it becomes available within a month or two.
