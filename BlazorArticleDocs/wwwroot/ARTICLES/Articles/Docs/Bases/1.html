<p>We will use the Blazor Web App and Blazor WebAssembly Standalone application templates, which are described in the article about installing the library.</p>

<p>
    Some solutions may vary depending on the type of application — in such cases, this will be clearly indicated.
    The library is designed so that as many features as possible work across both types of applications.
</p>

<h2 id="1">Basics</h2>

<h3 id="1-1">Article rendering</h3>

<p>As you can see on the <b>Article.razor</b> page in both applications the following component is responsible for article rendering.</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
    &lt;ArticleRenderer IContent="@_article" RemoveComments="true"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is a low-level component used to render an article exactly at a specified location.
    The article is re-rendered every time its parameters change.
    You can implement your own logic to decide whether and when the article should be re-rendered.
    The simplest solution is to place the component inside an if condition
</p>

<p>IContent can be any class that implements <b>IArticle</b> interface. You can use your own class or the one from the BlazorArticle library, such as in the template projects, which use <b>ModelArticleBase&lt;TId&gt;</b></p>

<p>In the future, the library is planned to support parsing articles not only in HTML format.</p>


<h3 id="1-2">Style managment</h3>

<p>In the <b>Article.razor</b> page in both application the <b>ArticleStyleContent</b> component is responsible for style rendering at place where the <b>ArticleStyleOutlet</b> component is rendered. See <b>App.razor</b> file in both applications.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.9em;">In the Blazor Web Application:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
    &lt;ArticleStyleContent Style="@_articleStyle.Content"  UseJavascript="true" IsCompressed="true"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p style="font-size:0.9em;">In the Blazor WebAssembly Application:</p>

<pre><code class="language-csharp">
    &lt;ArticleStyleContent Style="@_articleStyle.Content"  UseJavascript="false" IsCompressed="false"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
    The component behaves exactly the same in both application types, but it handles parameters differently.

    In a Blazor Web App, if the page is rendered statically (which is the default) and you apply the <b>[StreamRendering(true)]</b> attribute, the component uses JavaScript to render styles on the client side — as shown in the example.
    If the attribute is set to false, you can pre-render the styles on the server and disable JavaScript-based rendering.
    Style pre-rendering is enabled by default, but you can disable it by setting the component parameter: <b>IsPrerendered="false"</b>.
</p>

<p>If the page is rendered statically with <b>[StreamRendering(false)]</b> and style pre-rendering enabled, you will see the style code directly in the browser’s page source — exactly where the ArticleStyleContent component is rendered.</p>

<p>In Blazor WebAssembly Standalone, the <b>UseJavascript</b> parameter has no effect and is set to "false" by default to prevent styles from being rendered twice.</p>
